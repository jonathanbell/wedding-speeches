# Phil and Jess - August 11 2017

Good evening!

My wife told me to not drink before delivering my speech so, I'll keep this short.

So, I'm Jon, Phil's friend from high school and I'd like to tell you about the first time that I met Phil. See when Phil and I first met, we had no idea that we already sort of knew each other. Back then, before we officially knew each other I was known to Phil as the "Masked Waxer". That's because Phil and I used to skateboard at the same spot, only a block from both of our houses. I was that kid that would always put an ample amount of paraffin wax on the curb before skating it. I'd skate it for a little bit and then I'd go home and it would always really piss me off when I'd go back to that spot only to discover that all the wax was all used up by somebody else. Turns out, it was these two jokers right here!

So anyways, while that was going on, I started to get to know Phil (and Silas also) at school and we started skateboarding together. It wasn't until about halfway through the school year that I figured out that we all lived a few blocks from each others' houses. When I figured that out, I knew we were all going to be best buds.

So, believe it or not, Phil hasn't always been this cool - in fact, he was probably cooler as a teenager in the late 1990's - and that's saying something. Now granted, as a teenager, I was easier to impress. I remember this tall guy who had lived in Seattle and could skateboard really well. To be honest, I was probably hoping to score some of those sick moves on the deck. Seriously, this man can skateboard - a very real and fantastic life skill to have [similar to a degree in the arts]. Don't worry - I'll layoff.. I mean, you're already getting married today so that's like, stressful enough..

Seriously though, you guys are such a cute couple. I know because I follow you on Instagram, Phil. The proof is in the pixels, you guys - super cute, super cute... We get it.. The selfie stick is serving you well.

Jess, on the other hand, she posts more pictures of Dax than she does of Phil. Now, I don't know exactly what that means. I wouldn't count it as a measure of her love for one guy over another. Let's face it though, that guy's pretty good look'n.

Really though, Jess - I've never seen Phil more happy (or more put together, for that matter). I know that you two are going to have an amazing life together - and the best part is that this is just the beginning.

Jess and Phil, thank you again for this day - it's been an honor to witness the beginning of your happily ever after.

Everyone, you know what to do! Let's raise our glasses to this beautiful couple. Welcome to the club you guys! Cheers!!!
