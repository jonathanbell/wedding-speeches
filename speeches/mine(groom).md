On behalf of Christine and myself, thank you all for coming. Speaking for myself, I know I am nothing without the people who love and care for me in my life. I really don't know how we would  have done this without the help of everyone here. You've all been involved in some little (or large) way. Just an FYI: there's gonna be a lot of thank yous in this speech – buckle up!... So, thank you, first of all, to everyone who helped us along this path and who got us to this point. Dave & Kathy, and my parents: Mike and Pam – you are all so wonderful and supportive. I truly, truly love you guys. Hey, uh, can we just clap for a moment? [Clapping]

Alight.. Thanks everyone.

When I looked to Google for ideas about what a groom's speech is supposed to be, I found, "Thank the bride's family for welcoming you into the family, possibly share a story or example." Uh, well.. The thing is, Dave and Kathy, you make me feel welcome every single time I interact with you. So, I don't have a "story or example" - you're just that kind. There is just no way (and, I'm not being lazy here) that I could choose one "story or example" of your warmth and welcoming nature. I am sure though that everyone who knows you, knows how warm and thoughtful and wonderful you are – and, well, that's practically everyone here!

So, I do I want you both to know though, that I really feel that I've hit the jackpot when it comes to in-laws (and that's not always an easy thing to do, I hear..). You guys, right from day one, have made me feel comfortable and welcomed. When you meet someone for the first time, you never judge, ever – you just observe and I noticed that right away about you. It made me feel very safe and comfortable. I could then and can now be myself around you. Most of all, that is what I want to thank you for. Well, OK, good job on Christine too.. Thanks for her. Thank you.

Christine and I have some amazing friends, with whom we've had some great adventures. Like I said before, I am nothing without those around me and I know that a lot of you feel the same. We are so grateful for the help with the setup, organization, driving, emotional support, elbow grease, and energy that you guys have put in. Oh! And thank you for the crafts.. don't forget the crafts. Some of you guys travelled from pretty far away to be with us here today. That really means a lot to us, and it's a big gesture – thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you... I can't wait to share more of our lives together and to go on more adventures, whatever they may be. Having the friends like you guys at our sides smooths out the sharp edges of life and helps us believe in our potential. Thank you, thank you, thank you...

Hmm, let's see.. Ahhh.. yes! Kim and Johnny: Hi!.. I'm you're newest brother in-law. Whef... That didn't take long, eh? I'm pretty stoked that I don't have to say something like, "my girlfriend's sister's husband" when I refer to you in the third person anymore. What I mean is I'm excited (and so lucky!) to call you guys my "in-laws". I can't wait to live our lives in parallel and grow and thrive together. I've never had siblings, so I hope you guys won't mind if I don't just think of you as my brother and sister in-law but as my friends too. I can't wait until we're all old and grey and we sit around some porch somewhere and we say, "Hey, remember that time we had that rad adventure?"" Well, I can wait on the "old and grey" part – let's just skip to the "rad adventure" part. You guys are awesome. Again – I lucked out. Thanks.

Last, but not least, I want to thank my parents. You have both always been there for me, your guidance through my life has helped make me the person I am here today. Be it rides to Boy Scouts, mountain bike parts, sugar-fuelled birthday parties, kayaking and hiking to far off remote places or finding lost hamsters in typical hiding places – you've always been loving, patient and understanding. Thank you both for getting me here.

Can we just clap again please? [Clapping]

If we could go back in time here for a moment, I'd like to share a story about when I was a little boy. My dad decided that he was taking a vacation to Greece. The vacation would last three weeks. When I asked how long he would be gone for, he told me, "Three weeks." At the time, I was about four or five years old and I didn't understand. I had no way to comprehend how long 3 weeks was. So, I asked (straightforwardly), "How long is that?" and he told me, "Well... It's three weeks." To which I replied, "How long is that?" At this point, I don't think he knew what to say and had realized that I had no concept of three weeks. I can only image how he was finding a way to explain the timespan of three weeks to a four year old boy. Close your eyes for a moment, and imagine your four-year old self in my predicament. In the end, I think he said, "21 days." However, I still didn't get it. "Is that a long time?", I asked. I can't remember exactly what he said next, but I'm pretty sure he said, "Sort of. Not too long."

Christine and I have been together for about nine rotations of the Earth around the sun, that's about nine Earth years. When I tell people this, sometimes they'll say, "Oh wow, that's a long time!", but I disagree. In my mind, time doesn't work like this. It's not linear. It can slow down, speed up and sometimes, it might even stop (or pause) and no one can argue with me because I'm the groom.

Our hearts don't always follow the planetary movements. Love is beyond the stars. For me, the past 3351 days of my life have past in but a blink of the eye. It's been just a mere moment, jam packed to the brim with strong emotions and a beautiful, caring person to share it all with. You have been the most absolute proof that time truly does fly when you are having fun.

Thank you for your support and love. I am honoured that you have chosen to put your trust in me. Thank you for accepting me as who I am and for being my rock of support – you truly are unguarded with me and I will never let you down.

I'm older now, and I can feel what three weeks are better than before. Now, I realize that three weeks is in fact, 21 days. Or, that it's 504 hours. Or 30,240 minutes, or, 1,814,400 seconds... Oh and dad, you're right, three weeks, it's not a long time - and just for the record, nine years is only 152 trips to Greece.

I cannot wait to spend the next nine years together with you, Christine, and the next nine after that. The most cherished gift that you have given me is simply the time that we are together. Your sense of humour, your smile and your laugh, I have never found in another human being. Thank you for allowing me to share in your life.

I can only thank my lucky stars that today marks just but the beginning for you and me. I really feel that my life is complete now. I'm so happy that this moment, right here, is the beginning of a new path and that we will never have to guess at our anniversary date anymore and we will have a real date to mark our love and our beginning.

Everyone, can we please toast the bride?

I want to end with a quote. One of my favourite climbers, Conrad Anker said this: "Climbing is the only cure for gravity." Think about that one.

I love you babe, thank you.
